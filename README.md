ðŸ‘‹ ðŸ™‚ Hi, Iâ€™m @digvijaypundkar

ðŸ’»  Iâ€™m an aspiring data analyst with a strong passion for turning data into meaningful insights.

ðŸ§­  I enjoy exploring datasets, uncovering trends, and using data visualization tools like PowerBI & Tableau to present my findings in an engaging way.

âœ… I have experience with:
  * Data Manipulation: Proficient in Excel and SQL for data cleaning and transformation.
  * Statistical Analysis: Familiar with Python libraries such as Pandas, and NumPy for in-depth analysis.
  * Data Visualization: Creating interactive dashboards and visualizations in Tableau & PowerBI to communicate data stories effectively.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m committed to continuous learning and am currently expanding my skills in machine learning and advanced analytics. I believe that data has the power to drive better      decision-making and Iâ€™m excited to contribute to projects that harness this potential.

ðŸ‘€ Feel free to explore my repositories and reach out if youâ€™d like to connect or collaborate!
